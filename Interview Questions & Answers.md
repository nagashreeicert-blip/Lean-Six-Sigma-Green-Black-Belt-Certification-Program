## 🟢 Beginner Level (10 Questions)

1. **What is Lean Six Sigma?**  
   *Lean Six Sigma is a methodology that combines Lean (waste reduction) and Six Sigma (defect reduction) to improve processes and business outcomes.*

2. **What is the DMAIC framework?**  
   *DMAIC stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control. It is used to improve existing processes.*

3. **Difference between Green Belt and Black Belt?**  
   *Green Belts lead small projects and assist Black Belts; Black Belts lead enterprise-level projects and mentor Green Belts.*

4. **What is a Kaizen event?**  
   *A Kaizen event is a focused, short-term project to improve a specific process or area.*

5. **What are the 8 wastes in Lean?**  
   *TIMWOOD: Transport, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Overprocessing, Defects.*

6. **What is Value Stream Mapping (VSM)?**  
   *VSM is a tool used to visualize and analyze the flow of materials and information in a process.*

7. **What is a control chart?**  
   *A control chart monitors process behavior over time and identifies variation.*

8. **What is FMEA?**  
   *Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) identifies potential failure points in a process and their impact.*

9. **Difference between process capability Cp and Cpk?**  
   *Cp measures potential capability, Cpk measures actual capability considering process mean.*

10. **What is a SIPOC diagram?**  
    *SIPOC summarizes Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, and Customers of a process.*

## 🟡 Intermediate Level (10 Questions)

1. **Explain the difference between Lean and Six Sigma.**  
   *Lean focuses on speed and waste reduction; Six Sigma focuses on quality and reducing variation.*

2. **What is hypothesis testing in Six Sigma?**  
   *A statistical method to determine if there is enough evidence to support a specific claim about a process.*

3. **What is a process sigma level?**  
   *Sigma level indicates the number of defects per million opportunities in a process.*

4. **What are control limits vs. specification limits?**  
   *Control limits are statistical boundaries based on process behavior; specification limits are customer requirements.*

5. **Explain Design of Experiments (DOE).**  
   *DOE is a structured method to determine the relationship between factors affecting a process and its output.*

6. **What is a Black Belt project?**  
   *A complex project focused on enterprise-level improvement, led by a Black Belt.*

7. **What is process mapping?**  
   *A visual representation of the steps in a process to identify waste and improvement opportunities.*

8. **Difference between qualitative and quantitative risk analysis?**  
   *Qualitative assesses impact and likelihood subjectively; quantitative uses numerical data and statistical methods.*

9. **Explain Pareto Analysis.**  
   *A technique that identifies the most significant factors contributing to a problem (80/20 rule).*

10. **What is a Gantt chart used for?**  
    *To plan and track project timelines, tasks, and dependencies.*

## 🔴 Advanced Level (10 Questions)

1. **Explain multivariate analysis in Six Sigma.**  
   *A statistical technique to analyze multiple variables and their interactions affecting a process outcome.*

2. **What is Design for Six Sigma (DFSS)?**  
   *A methodology to design new processes or products that meet Six Sigma quality levels from the start.*

3. **Explain process capability indices Cpm and Cpk.**  
   *Cpk considers the process mean vs. specification limits; Cpm accounts for target value deviation.*

4. **How do you perform a root cause analysis using data?**  
   *Use tools like Fishbone Diagram, 5 Whys, and statistical analysis to identify the underlying cause of defects.*

5. **Explain Monte Carlo simulation in process improvement.**  
   *A technique to model uncertainty and risk in processes using random sampling and statistical modeling.*

6. **What is a control plan?**  
   *A document that outlines how process performance will be monitored and controlled post-implementation.*

7. **Explain Kaizen Blitz vs. standard Kaizen.**  
   *Kaizen Blitz is a rapid, short-term improvement; standard Kaizen is ongoing continuous improvement.*

8. **How do you measure ROI for a Lean Six Sigma project?**  
   *Compare the financial benefits (cost savings, revenue gains) against project investment.*

9. **What is MSA (Measurement System Analysis)?**  
   *MSA evaluates the accuracy and consistency of measurement systems to ensure data reliability.*

10. **How do you mentor Green Belts as a Black Belt?**  
    *Provide guidance on DMAIC projects, ensure proper statistical analysis, and assist in implementing solutions.*
